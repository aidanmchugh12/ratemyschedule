Overview:
    The program is a schedule grader that evaluates a user's course schedule based on certain criteria:
    1. The rmp_grading.py file averages three criteria
        a. The professors current rating out of five (where decimals are allowed)
        b. The difficulty of a certain class with said professor
        c. The 'would take again' percentage in terms of the class with said professor
        This average ends up a number out of 5 and the higher it is the better therefore making the overall letter grade better.

    2. The breaks_grading.py file compares the length of the break between classes with the time it takes to walk to that class (also on a scale of five)
        - The program then subtracts these two values to see the difference between how long you have and how long it'll take you to get to class
        - The program uses the coordinates of the buildings to generate how long it will take to walk between them
        
        rating breakdown:
        difference < 2 is given a 1
        difference < 4 is given a 2
        difference < 6 is given a 3
        difference < 10 is given a 4
        difference >= 10 is given a 5

        example: Benedum Hall to Cathedral of Learning is a 9 minute walk and Lena has 10 minutes between the classes in those two buildings so it would rate it a 1

    The credit_grading.py file give a rating based on the amount of credits you are taking
        rating breakdown:
       A 1 is the worst ranking, you have a lot of credits and have a packed schedule.
       A 2 is bad, but better than 1. You have a very tough schedule.
       A 3 is medium difficulty, it's manageable, but could be better.
       A 4 is a good schedule, it's slightly challenging but very possible and balanced.
       A 5 is a perfect schedule, you are taking a very manageable amount of credits.
       
       Make sure you justify your math equation of the total credits
        
    All three of these components are then combined in the function def get_overall_grade in the app.py file. The following code takes the grade from each of the above criteria and assigns a letter grade based on the value.
    The numbers that total_sum is currently compared to is arbitrary and is just shown to explain how the ratings return a grade of the person's schedule.

    def get_overall_grade(grade1, grade2, grade3):
        total_sum = grade1 + grade2 + grade3
        
        if total_sum >= 13.5:
            return 'A'
        elif total_sum >= 11.5:
            return 'B'
        elif total_sum >= 10.5:
            return 'C'
        elif total_sum >= 8:
            return 'D'
        return 'F'

    Input and Output Structure:

    The user is able to input their schedule as a .ics (that can be downloaded straight from their peopleSoft application) amd the program will convert it to a .csv file to read all the data.
    - this includes: class name, professor, credits, start time, end time, duration of class

    It will output a grade (A,B,C,D,F) based on the grading (out of 5) of all the criteria above. Each of the criteria is given the same weightage so as to ensure there is no human bias towards which criteria "affects" a schedule the most.


    I want you to write out a blurb (Between 100-150 characters) on why a student got a specific grade based on their criteria using data from the CSV to explain it to them.
